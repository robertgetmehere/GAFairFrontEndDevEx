			        Ok, I get it. We're big, we're powerful, and we’re scary. We live in an environment that's foreign to you, which may as well make us monsters. Although Jaws may be a great film - and I can't help but be a little awed by the portrayal - it's grossly inaccurate.

		        Newsflash: Seals are delicious. This, of course, is hardly news by any means. However, dining on these treats day-after-day can start to wear thin.

		        But did you know there's so many ways to tear in? It's true! And the approach you take can have a real impact on your meal. So before you thrash around aimlessly, consider the following before your next meal: READ MORE…
